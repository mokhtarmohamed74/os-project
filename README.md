Project description: 
Implement a program that execute these tasks: 
 
Project Should: 
 Add/delete users 
 Add/delete groups 
 Change information of users (ex: password and full name) 
 Assign specific users to specific groups 
 
Required points to be in the project: 
1- The project should execute (run) in the terminal and from any path (directory) 
the terminal currently exist.  
Example:  
pc@pc-virtualbox:~#  project2 
pc@pc-virtualbox:/home/pc/Desktop#  project2 
 
 
2- GUI (Graphical User Interface) 
The project should have GUI (i.e. buttons, textboxes, etc.) 
 
 
3- The project has to provide a GUI Menu interface to let the user picks the option 
he wants.  
Example: when user writes “project2” in the terminal, the project should execute 
and a GUI menu should appear to let the user picks task he wants. 
 
 
4- The project should not be closed after executing only one task, instead the GUI 
menu interface has to re-appear until the user picks exit (close project). 
 
 
 
5- You have to implement the manual page for your project. You should structure 
your manual page to have the same format as any other manual page. 
Example: if the project name is “project2”, when the user types “man project2” in 
the terminal, the manual page for your project should appear. 
 
 
6- You should implement Shortest Job Next (SJN) Scheduling algorithm 
Enter 4 processes. Each has (process id, arrive time, burst time) 
Calculate the Turnaround time for each process, Total Turnaround time, and 
Average Turnaround time.
